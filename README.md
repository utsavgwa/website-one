# Website One
This is my first website, and it is designed to seem like a local newspaper that we read.

Here, I learned about **HTML** and **CSS** syntax by using various **tags** and their characteristics. I also learned about **CSS properties** like **classes**, **pseudo-classes**, **the cascade**, **the box model**, and many **flex box** properties.
